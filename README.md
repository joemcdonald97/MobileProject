# MobileProject

A mobile application I developed for university. The aim of the appliation was to match university students to suitable tutors. 

A video demonstration can be found at https://youtu.be/DWtEkOhlpk4

The application was developed in andriod studio and the full project is unfortunatley locked in my university GitHub, however the bulk of the Java files can be found in this repository. 

This project was graded at 93%.
